Also while you were busy and I had nothing else, I have started to work on booking website... And this is driving me crazy, because I dont understand data structure in there. When I try to pull data it shows false...
booking_info = Child_Booking_Profile[Show_basic_booking_information != null];


for each rec in booking_info
{
rec.field_name; //to show the field value for all the records
}
It is the link name of a field that you wish to show.

In this case, it is Show_basic_booking_information

Needs sorting days depending on current day.
Ok. In this case, you can get the day of the date or the current date using this function getDayOfWeek function

https://www.zoho.com/deluge/help/functions/datetime/getdayofweek.html

The resultant of this function would be like below

1 represents Sunday, 2 represents Monday, and so on, with 7 being the final number representing Saturday.

So based on value returned, using 'if' block you can fetch the value stored in respective field.

Eg:
currentDate = '15-Mar-2019';
dayNumber = currentDate.getDayOfWeek(); // returns 6 (meaning Friday)

if(dayNumber==6)
{
//fetch the Friday_Session_End_Time and Friday_Session_Start_Time
}

Similary, you can configure the similar if blocks for rest of the days.
