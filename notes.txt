Also while you were busy and I had nothing else, I have started to work on booking website... And this is driving me crazy, because I dont understand data structure in there. When I try to pull data it shows false...
booking_info = Child_Booking_Profile[Show_basic_booking_information != null];


for each rec in booking_info
{
rec.field_name; //to show the field value for all the records
}
It is the link name of a field that you wish to show.

In this case, it is Show_basic_booking_information
